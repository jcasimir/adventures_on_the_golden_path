Let's Do Better

### Conclusion Ideas

* Models
	* attr_accessible in comments
	* attr_accessible by default
	* ActiveRecord as a module
		* Make private?

* Controllers
	* Composition over Inheritance
	* Instance Variables vs Accessors / "Helper Methods"
	* Simplify 

* Helpers
	* Die
	* Something in SOLID about only providing what you need
	* Helpers as modules or classes

* Views
	* PJax?
	* Instance variables are dead
	* Draper, etc
		* Lessons learned?

* Routes
	* Strip the comments to just the best practices
	* Just treat the Router as an object
		Route.article(id), Route.articles, Route.edit_article
	* What if Routes worked like ARel:
		Route.article(id).edit
		Route.article(id).destroy
